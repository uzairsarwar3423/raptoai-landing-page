## 1. Overview & Pricing Philosophy

Vocaply employs a **Flat Team-Based Pricing Model** combined with **Usage-Gated Tiers**. 

### Key Architectural & Commercial Principles:
1. **Zero Seat Anxiety:** Traditional per-seat pricing deters team adoption and viral growth. Vocaply charges a flat monthly rate per team tier, encouraging managers to onboard all engineers, designers, and product owners without incremental line-item friction.
2. **Usage-Based Infrastructure Alignment:** System cost overhead is primarily driven by processed meeting minutes (AI transcription, LLM pipeline processing, and vector indexing) rather than raw user accounts. Tier boundaries align directly with meeting volume limits.
3. **High ROI Ratio:** A team saving 2.5 hours per engineer every week achieves a 5x–20x ROI on even the highest flat monthly tier.
